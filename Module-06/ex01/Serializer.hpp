/*
üõ†Ô∏è 3. reinterpret_cast
‚ùó Dangerous and low-level cast; bitwise reinterpretation
Used for:
Casting between unrelated pointer types
Casting an integer to a pointer or vice versa
For very low-level system code, such as implementing custom memory management or interfacing with hardware

eg:
cast int * to char *

10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010

to 

10101010

both pointer points to the first bit of the same memory address, 
but where they stop reading is different.
